# Data Modeling
### Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development?
1) TDD creates code that is maintainable, flexible, and easily extensible.<br>
2) The programmer’s productivity is increased.<br>
3) Spending less time in the debugger.<br>

### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
If you need to setup a mock object or data structure and this object or structure can be reused by all the tests in a single describe, you can use before to set it up, and after to tear it down. This could be the case if you are doing read-only tests on the structure.[Stackoverfloe](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21418580/what-is-the-difference-between-before-and-beforeeach#:~:text=If%20each%20test%20in%20your,to%20tear%20it%20down%20cleanly.)
### What is one downside of Test Driven Development?
Slow process : If you begin TDD, you’ll get the sensation that you simply need an extended duration of your time for straightforward implementations. you would like to believe the interfaces, write the test code, and run the tests before you’ll finally start writing the code.[Geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-test-driven-development-tdd/).
### What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
It's easier to handle and to read.
### Why REST?
1) REST allows a greater variety of data formats.<br>
2) REST provides superior performance, particularly through caching for information that’s not altered and not dynamic.<br>
3) REST is generally faster and uses less bandwidth. It’s also easier to integrate with existing websites with no need to refactor site infrastructure. This enables developers to work faster rather than spend time rewriting a site from scratch. Instead, they can simply add additional functionality.<br>

## TERMS
### functional programming
Functional programming is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects,functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions.[medium](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0#:~:text=Functional%20programming%20(often%20abbreviated%20FP,state%20flows%20through%20pure%20functions.)
### object-oriented programming (OOP)
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental programming paradigm used by nearly every developer at some point in their career. [educative](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming)
### class
Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.
### super
The super keyword refers to the parent class. It is used to call the constructor of the parent class and to access the parent's properties and methods.[W3S](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_class_super.asp#:~:text=Definition%20and%20Usage,the%20parent's%20properties%20and%20methods.)
### this
The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to.
### Test Driven Development (TDD)
 is software development approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do. In simple terms, test cases for each functionality are created and tested first and if the test fails then the new code is written in order to pass the test and making code simple and bug-free.

### Jest
Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity, it works with projects using: Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue and more.[jestjs](https://jestjs.io/)
### Continuous Integration (CI)
Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) embody a culture, set of operating principles, and collection of practices that enable application development teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably. The implementation is also known as the CI/CD pipeline. [infoworld](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3271126/what-is-cicd-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-explained.html)
### REST
REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. REST-compliant systems, often called RESTful systems, are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server. We will go into what these terms mean and why they are beneficial characteristics for services on the Web. [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-rest)
### Data Model
Data model is a set or collection of construct used for creating a database and producing designs for the databases. [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55804165/what-is-the-difference-between-data-model-and-database-model#:~:text=Database%20design%20is%20stored%20in,producing%20designs%20for%20the%20databases.)
