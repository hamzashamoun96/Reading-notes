# Component Composition

### Can a parent component access the state of a child component?
Yes
### What can be passed along in a prop variable?
Everything ( variables , functions , objects ........ )
### How can a child component “know” the state of another component?
To obtain the state of another component, you can pass the component’s state to it’s child components as props. You can also have components share a common ancestor, and have them access the same state in a similar manner.

## Terms
### component props
* Props are arguments passed into React components.
* Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.
* React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML. [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_props.asp#:~:text=Props%20are%20arguments%20passed%20into,to%20components%20via%20HTML%20attributes.)

### component state
* React components has a built-in state object.
* The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.
* When the state object changes, the component re-renders. [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_state.asp#:~:text=React%20components%20has%20a%20built,%2C%20the%20component%20re%2Drenders.)
### application state
Application State (also known as Program State) represents the totality of everything necessary to keep your application running.  When we refer to application state we are normally referring to the state of the program as it exists in the contents of its memory.

## props.children
props.children is available on every component. It contains the content between the opening and closing tags of a component. [ReactDocs](https://reactjs.org/docs/glossary.html#propschildren).

## Composition vs Inheritance

* React has a powerful composition model, and we recommend using composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components.
* At Facebook, we use React in thousands of components, and we haven’t found any use cases where we would recommend creating component inheritance hierarchies.
* Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a component’s look and behavior in an explicit and safe way. [ReactDocs](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)

## React if component
* In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.
* Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.
