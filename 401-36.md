# Application State with Redux

### What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”
* The stored data has no expiration date in local storage. With cookies, you can set the expiration duration.
* Local Storage is for client side, whereas cookies are for the client as well as server side.
### Explain 3rd party cookies.
* Third-party cookies are created by domains that are not the website (or domain) that you are visiting. These are usually used for online-advertising purposes and placed on a website through a script or tag.
* A third-party cookie is accessible on any website that loads the third-party server's code.
### How do pixel tags work?
* The website operator or sender of an email adds the tracking pixel using a code in the website’s HTML code or email. This code contains an external link to the pixel server. If a user visits the destination website, the HTML code is processed by the client – usually the user’s browser. The browser follows the link and opens the (invisible) graphic. This is registered and noted in the server’s log files. [ryte](https://en.ryte.com/wiki/Tracking_Pixel)

## Term
### cookies
Cookies are text files with small pieces of data — like a username and password — that are used to identify your computer as you use a computer network. Specific cookies known as HTTP cookies are used to identify specific users and improve your web browsing experience. [kaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/cookies)
### authorization
Authorization is a security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources including files, services, computer programs, data and application features. [economictimes](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/authorization)
### access control
Access control is a security technique that regulates who or what can view or use resources in a computing environment. It is a fundamental concept in security that minimizes risk to the business or organization.

### conditional rendering
Conditional rendering is a term to describe the ability to render different user interface (UI) markup if a condition is true or false. In React, it allows us to render different elements or components based on a condition.

## Redux
* Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
* It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience.
* With Redux, the state of your application is kept in a store, and each component can access any state that it needs from this store.

### Redux is maintainable
Redux is strict about how code should be organized, which makes it easier for someone with knowledge of Redux to understand the structure of any Redux application. This generally makes it easier to maintain. This also helps you segregate your business logic from your component tree. For large scale apps, it’s critical to keep your app more predictable and maintainable.
