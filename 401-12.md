# Socket.io

### What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?
Packet switching is used to optimize the use of the channel capacity available in digital telecommunication networks, such as computer networks, and minimize the transmission latency (the time it takes for data to pass across the network), and to increase robustness of communication. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching#:~:text=Packet%20switching%20is%20used%20to,to%20increase%20robustness%20of%20communication.).
### UDP is often referred to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?
Because doesn't establish a connection before sending data, it just sends the data.
### Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?
Yes.
### Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?
No.
### Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?
Yes.

### Observer Pattern
The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. [webdevstudios](https://webdevstudios.com/2019/02/19/observable-pattern-in-javascript/#:~:text=According%20to%20Wikipedia%3A,one%2Dto%2Dmany%20relationship.).
### Listener
An event listener is a procedure in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur.
### Event Handler
An event handler is a callback routine that operates asynchronously and handles inputs received into a program (events). [searchapparchitecture](https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/event-handler)
### Event Driven Programming
Event-driven programming is when a program is designed to respond to user engagement in various forms. It is known as a programming paradigm in which the flow of program execution is determined by events. [edgetechacademy](https://www.edgetechacademy.edu/node-js/event-driven-programming/)
### Event Loop
Event loop is a programming construct or design pattern that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program. The event loop works by making a request to some internal or external "event provider" (that generally blocks the request until an event has arrived), then calls the relevant event handler ("dispatches the event"). [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop)
### Event Queue
An event queue is a repository where events from an application are held prior to being processed by a receiving program or system. Event queues are often used in the context of an enterprise messaging system. [techopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24963/event-queue#:~:text=An%20event%20queue%20is%20a,of%20an%20enterprise%20messaging%20system.)
### Call Stack
call stack is a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program. This kind of stack is also known as an execution stack, control stack, run-time stack, or machine stack, and is often shortened to just "the stack". [definitions](https://www.definitions.net/definition/call+stack)
### Emit/Raise/Trigger
Emit is sending a message to trigger and raise an event.

### database
A database is a systematic collection of data. They support electronic storage and manipulation of data. Databases make data management easy. [guru99](https://www.guru99.com/introduction-to-database-sql.html)

## WebSocket
*  is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
* The WebSocket protocol enables interaction between a web browser (or other client application) and a web server with lower overhead than half-duplex alternatives such as HTTP polling, facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the server.

## Socket.IO
* enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication.
* It works on every platform, browser or device, focusing equally on reliability and speed.
*  It is built on top of the WebSockets API (Client side) and Node.js, it is one of the most depended upon library on npm.
* It automatically upgrades the requirement to WebSocket if needed.
* It is a custom real-time transport protocol implementation on top of other protocols.
