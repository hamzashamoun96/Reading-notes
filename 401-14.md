# Trees

### Common Terminology
* Node : Tree node may have a value and a references to other nodes.
* Root : is the node at the beginning.
* K : The maximum number of childern node may have in a tree ( k = 2 ) in a binary tree.
* Left : a reference to one child node in a binary tree.
Right : a reference to the other child node.
* Edge : The link between the parent and the child node.
* Leaf : a node that doesn't have children.
* Height : The nmber edges from the root to the last leaf.

## Traversals
Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node , print out the contents of a tree.

### Depth First
Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first.
Here are three methods for depth first traversal:

Pre-order: root >> left >> right<br>
In-order: left >> root >> right<br>
Post-order: left >> right >> root<br>

### Breadth First
Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.

### K-ary Trees
A tree that it's nodes may have more than 2 child nodes.
### Big O 
he Big O time complexity for inserting a new node is O(n). Searching for a specific node will also be O(n).

### Searching a BST
Searching a BST can be done quickly, because all you do is compare the node you are searching for against the root of the tree or sub-tree. If the value is smaller, you only traverse the left side. If the value is larger, you only traverse the right side.
