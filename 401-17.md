# AWS: S3 and Lambda

### What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
A standard queue tries to preserve the order of messages (best-effort), but there is a possibility of a message being delivered out of order , In a FIFO queue, messages are grouped into “Message groups” and all messages within a message group are sent and received in strict order. [learnaws](https://www.learnaws.org/2020/12/21/aws-sqs-fifo-deep-dive/#:~:text=A%20standard%20queue%20tries%20to,and%20received%20in%20strict%20order.)
### How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
By having an event in the client side to emit what received from the server side.
### What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
The Observer pattern.
### How do you test an event driven system?
By unit test.

### Server Instances
A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based. The instances are not linked with each other and can be controlled or managed separately. [techopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32149/server-instance#:~:text=A%20server%20instance%20is%20a,based%20or%20command%2Dline%20based.)
### Containers
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. [docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container#:~:text=A%20container%20is%20a%20standard,one%20computing%20environment%20to%20another.&text=Available%20for%20both%20Linux%20and,same%2C%20regardless%20of%20the%20infrastructure.)
### Cloud Services
Cloud services are services available via a remote cloud computing server rather than an on-site server. These scalable solutions are managed by a third party and provide users with access to computing services such as analytics or networking via the internet.[akamai](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/resources/cloud-services.jsp)
### Cloud Architecture
Cloud architecture is how individual technologies are integrated to create clouds—IT environments that abstract, pool, and share scalable resources across a network.  [redhat](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-is-cloud-architecture)
### AWS
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings. AWS services can offer an organization tools such as compute power, database storage and content delivery services. [searchaws](https://searchaws.techtarget.com/definition/Amazon-Web-Services)
### EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku
* Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is an Infrastructure as a Service product, and is Amazon’s flagship offering. 
* Elastic Compute Cloud provides us only with the building blocks. Our task is to select the best blocks for our application and actively manage them, not only set them up.
* Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) product based on AWS, and is vastly different from Elastic Compute Cloud. It’s very important to differentiate ‘Infrastructure as a Service’ and ‘Platform as a Service’ solutions as we consider deploying and supporting our application using these two solutions.
* Heroku is way simpler to use than AWS Elastic Compute Cloud. [rubygarage](https://rubygarage.org/blog/heroku-vs-amazon-web-services)

## Amazon S3
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics. Amazon S3 provides easy-to-use management features so you can organize your data and configure finely-tuned access controls to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.[amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

## AWS Lambda
* AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.

* The Lambda functions can perform any kind of computing task, from serving web pages and processing streams of data to calling APIs and integrating with other AWS services.

* The concept of “serverless” computing refers to not needing to maintain your own servers to run these functions. AWS Lambda is a fully managed service that takes care of all the infrastructure for you. And so “serverless” doesn’t mean that there are no servers involved: it just means that the servers, the operating systems, the network layer and the rest of the infrastructure have already been taken care of, so that you can focus on writing application code.
