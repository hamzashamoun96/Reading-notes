### Describe use cases for useMemo() and useReducer()
* The dependencies act similar to arguments in a function. The dependency’s list are the elements useMemo watches: if there are no changes, the function result will stay the same. Otherwise, it will re-run the function. If they don’t change, it doesn’t matter if our entire component re-renders, the function won’t re-run but instead return the stored result. This can be optimal if the wrapped function is large and expensive. That is the primary use for useMemo. [digitalocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/react-usememo)
* useReducer is one of a handful of React hooks that shipped in React 16.7. 0. It accepts a reducer function with the application initial state, returns the current application state, then dispatches a function.

### Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?
to make a custom hook out of this component logic, we need to extract useState and handlers into a separate function and move it in a separate file. A custom hook name should start with a prefix use, that will indicate the usage of hooks inside it. [dev](https://dev.to/spukas/react-hooks-creating-custom-state-hook-300c)
### What do custom hooks usually do?
Custom Hooks are a mechanism to reuse stateful logic (such as setting up a subscription and remembering the current value), but every time you use a custom Hook, all state and effects inside of it are fully isolated. [reactJS](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html#:~:text=Custom%20Hooks%20are%20a%20mechanism,a%20Hook%20gets%20isolated%20state.)
### Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications
react-fetch-hook
### Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work
useFetch hook gets us the data and the isLoading state.
We can also provide the required options object to the hook.

## Term
### reducer
A reducer is a function that determines changes to an application's state. It uses the action it receives to determine this change. We have tools, like Redux, that help manage an application's state changes in a single store so that they behave consistently. [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/understanding-how-reducers-are-used-in-redux/#:~:text=A%20reducer%20is%20a%20function,so%20that%20they%20behave%20consistently.)

### Context
* Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
* In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but such usage can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.
