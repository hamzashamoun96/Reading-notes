# Objects
* To create objects using JavaScript use new keyword and the object() constructor function.
* Use dot notation or square brackets to update the value of a property and to delete a property use delete keyword.
* We can use a function as a template for creating several objects to represent similar things, then we can just write the new keyword followed by a call of that function to create a new object.
* The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects, Where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers to one object, usually the object in which the function operates.
* Arrays are a special type of objects they both can hold multiple values but the key for each value in arrays will be its index number.
* Objects can hold Arrays and Arrays can hold Objects.
* There are three groups of built-in objects: Browser object model (creates a model of the browser tab or window), Document object model (creates a model of the current web page), Global JavaScript object (They are a group of individual objects that relate to different parts of the JavaScript language).
