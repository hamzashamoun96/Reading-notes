# Linked Lists

* A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other , and the most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link. There are two types of Linked List : Singly and Doubly.
* Linked List is data stracture that contains nodes that link to next node.
* A linked list is usually efficient when it comes to adding and removing most elements, but can be very slow to search and find a single element.
* Singly it refers to number of ref, singly Linked list have only one ref . only next()

* Doubly is to have double ref , next() and previous().

* Next it refers to next node.

* Head it refers to type of first node linked list.

* Current it refers to currently node.

* A node only knows about what data it contains, and who its neighbor is.
* linked list is Linear data structure means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed

## Linked Lists V.S Arrays
* The biggest differentiator between arrays and linked lists is the way that they use memory in our machines so when an array is created, it needs a certain amount of memory. If we had 7 letters that we needed to store in an array, we would need 7 bytes of memory to represent that array. But, we’d need all of that memory in one contiguous block.
* When a linked list is born, it doesn’t need 7 bytes of memory all in one place. One byte could live somewhere, while the next byte could be stored in another place in memory altogether.

## Traversal
* The best way to approach a traversal is through the use of a while() loop. This allows us to continually check that the Next node in the list is not null. There are two major points to consider when thinking about how an algorithm performs: how much time it requires at runtime given how much time and memory it needs.
