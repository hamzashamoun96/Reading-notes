# Links
* Links are created using < a> tag, users can click between the opening and closing a tag and go to the specify page you want them to go.
* < a> tags have an attribute (href) we put in it the url of the page we want the user go to, and between the opening and closing tag we put the name of the link which the user will click on.
* Also we can link other page in the same site, using relative URLs which are provided as a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.
* We can link an email to sent to when cick on by using < a> tag with (href) attribute inside it (mailto:) and the email address.
* If we want to open a link in a new window we add a (target) attribute with a value (_blank).
* If we want to link to a specific section in the same page, we should give that section an id the in the (href) we put that id to link to.

# Layout
* < div> elements are often use as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
* If a block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the container or parent element.
* CSS has positioning schemes that control the layout of a page: Relative position which allows to shift an element to the top, right, left, bottom and this will not affect the position of the surrounding elements, Absolute position which allows to shift an element to the top, right, left, bottom in relation to its containing element and this will not affect the position of the surrounding elements.
* Fixed position which position the element in relation to the browser window and this will not affect the position of the surrounding elements and the element will not move when the user scrolls up or down.
* Floating elements allows you to position it to the far right or left of a containing box and the floated element becomes a block-level element.
* When you use positioning, the boxes can overlap eachother, to control that use (z-index).
* Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around (960-1000) pixels wide.

# Functions, Methods and Objects
 * Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 
 * In function we can return more than one value by using an array.
 * Variable's scope states that when you declare a variable inside a function it can only be used within that function.
 * Local varibles is created inside a function using the (var) keyword and it can only be used inside that fubction, Global variables is created outside a function and then it can be used anywhere inside the script.
