# AWS : API, Dynamo and Lambda

### What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
A standard queue tries to preserve the order of messages (best-effort), but there is a possibility of a message being delivered out of order , In a FIFO queue, messages are grouped into “Message groups” and all messages within a message group are sent and received in strict order.

### How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
By having an event in the client side to emit what received from the server side.
### What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
The Observer pattern.
### How do you test an event driven system?
By unit test.

### Serverless Functions
A serverless function is a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It's then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies. These companies take care of code maintenance and execution so that developers can deploy new code faster and easier. [hubspot](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/serverless-functions)
### Cloud Storage
Cloud storage is a cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet through a cloud computing provider who manages and operates data storage as a service. It’s delivered on demand with just-in-time capacity and costs, and eliminates buying and managing your own data storage infrastructure. This gives you agility, global scale and durability, with “anytime, anywhere” data access. [amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-storage/)
### CDN
A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/)

## Amazon API Gateway
* Is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

* API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management. API Gateway has no minimum fees or startup costs. You pay for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out and, with the API Gateway tiered pricing model, you can reduce your cost as your API usage scales.

## DynamoDB
DynamoDB is a hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It offers:
* Reliable performance even as it scales.
* A managed experience, so you won't be SSH-ing into servers to upgrade the crypto libraries.
* A small, simple API allowing for simple key-value access as well as more advanced query patterns.
