### Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?
When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.

### Rendering
Rendering is the process of gathering data (if any) and load the associated templates (or just send the output directly). Then apply the gathered data to the associated templates. The final output is sent to the user. [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16518951/rendering-in-context-of-web-development)
### Templates
Templates are the foundation of generic programming, which involves writing code in a way that is independent of any particular type , a template is a blueprint or formula for creating a generic class or a function. [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_templates.htm#:~:text=Templates%20are%20the%20foundation%20of,generic%20class%20or%20a%20function.)
### State
is information your program manipulates to accomplish some task. It is data or information that gets changed or manipulated throughout the runtime of a program. [softwareengineering](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/150120/definition-of-state#:~:text=State%20is%20information%20your%20program,the%20runtime%20of%20a%20program.)

## React
* is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library[3] for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
* React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library))
## JSX
* JSX is an XML/HTML-like syntax used by React that extends ECMAScript so that XML/HTML-like text can co-exist with JavaScript/React code. The syntax is intended to be used by preprocessors (i.e., transpilers like Babel) to transform HTML-like text found in JavaScript files into standard JavaScript objects that a JavaScript engine will parse.
* Basically, by using JSX you can write concise HTML/XML-like structures (e.g., DOM like tree structures) in the same file as you write JavaScript code, then Babel will transform these expressions into actual JavaScript code. Unlike the past, instead of putting JavaScript into HTML, JSX allows us to put HTML into JavaScript. [reactenlightenment](https://www.reactenlightenment.com/react-jsx/5.1.html)
