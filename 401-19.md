# AWS: Events

### What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
A standard queue tries to preserve the order of messages (best-effort), but there is a possibility of a message being delivered out of order , In a FIFO queue, messages are grouped into “Message groups” and all messages within a message group are sent and received in strict order.

### How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
By having an event in the client side to emit what received from the server side.
### What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
The Observer pattern.
### How do you test an event driven system?
By unit test.

### Serverless API
An AWS Serverless Api resource need not be explicitly added to a AWS Serverless Application Definition template. A resource of this type is implicitly created from the union of Api events defined on AWS Serverless Function resources defined in the template that do not refer to an AWS Serverless Api resource.
An AWS Serverless Api resource should be used to define and document the API using OpenApi, which provides more ability to configure the underlying Amazon API Gateway resources. [AWS-Amazon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-resource-api.html)
### Triggers
Every event is triggered when the application runs. Some events can be triggered as a response to an external activation, such as when a key is pressed or when the mouse is clicked. Other events can be triggered when a certain stage in the application is reached, such as an elapsed time period. This technical overview illustrates how events are defined in uniPaaS, and also shows that some events can be defined as triggers of other events.

### Dynamo Vs Mongo
* MongoDB is vendor agnostic, Open Source, and can be deployed anywhere. DynamoDB is only available on AWS.
* DynamoDB is a fully managed AWS service, MongoDB can be self installed or fully managed with MongoDB Atlas.
* DynamoDB as an integrated AWS service makes it easier to develop end to end solutions.
* DynamoDB uses tables, items and attributes, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents.
* DynamoDB supports limited data types and smaller item sizes; MongoDB supports more data types and has fewer size restrictions. [xplenty](https://www.xplenty.com/blog/dynamodb-vs-mongodb-differences/#:~:text=DynamoDB%20is%20a%20fully%20managed,fully%20managed%20with%20MongoDB%20Atlas.&text=DynamoDB%20uses%20tables%2C%20items%20and,and%20has%20fewer%20size%20restrictions.)
### Dynamoose Vs Mongoose
* Dynamoose is a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB (inspired by Mongoose).
* Dynobase helps you accelerate your DynamoDB workflow with code generation, faster data exploration, bookmarks and more.

## AWS — Difference between SQS and SNS
* SNS is a distributed publish-subscribe system. Messages are pushed to subscribers as and when they are sent by publishers to SNS.
* Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a fully managed messaging service for both application-to-application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P) communication.
* The A2A pub/sub functionality provides topics for high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging between distributed systems, microservices, and event-driven serverless applications. Using Amazon SNS topics, your publisher systems can fanout messages to a large number of subscriber systems including Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions and HTTPS endpoints, for parallel processing, and Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. The A2P functionality enables you to send messages to users at scale via SMS, mobile push, and email. [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc)
* SQS is distributed queuing system. Messages are not pushed to receivers. Receivers have to poll or pull messages from SQS.
* Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SQS eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating message oriented middleware, and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work.
* Using SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available. Get started with SQS in minutes using the AWS console, Command Line Interface or SDK of your choice, and three simple commands. [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/)
