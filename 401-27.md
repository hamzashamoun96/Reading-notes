# Props and State

### Does a deployed React application require a server?
No.
### Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?
Iteration speed vs Realistic environment: Some tools offer a very quick feedback loop between making a change and seeing the result, but don’t model the browser behavior precisely. Other tools might use a real browser environment, but reduce the iteration speed and are flakier on a continuous integration server. [reactjs](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html)
### What does npm run build do?
npm run build creates a build directory with a production build of your app. [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/)
### Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application
* Composition is the act of combining parts or elements to form a whole. Components are the UI building blocks in React applications, like pure functions are the building blocks of function composition. [medium](https://medium.com/leanjs/react-is-all-about-composition-f9f49dec183c#:~:text=Composition%20is%20the%20act%20of,building%20blocks%20of%20function%20composition.)
* Unlike other UI libraries and frameworks, Reactjs doesn’t enforce an architecture pattern. It is just a view that caters to the user interface , just beneath the user interface lies a tree of several React components. In general terms, a react component is nothing but the central structural unit — something minimal, like a button, label, or text input label or perhaps something more complex, like a registration form, user-profile, etc. [simform](https://www.simform.com/react-architecture-best-practices/)

## Terms

### BDD
Behavior Driven Development is an Agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, QA, and non-technical or business participants in a software project It encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave. It emerged from test-driven development (TDD). Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)
### Acceptance Tests
testing technique performed to determine whether or not the software system has met the requirement specifications. The main purpose of this test is to evaluate the system's compliance with the business requirements and verify if it is has met the required criteria for delivery to end users. [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_testing_dictionary/acceptance_testing.htm#:~:text=Acceptance%20testing%2C%20a%20testing%20technique,for%20delivery%20to%20end%20users.)
### Mounting
 is a process by which the operating system makes files and directories on a storage device (such as hard drive, CD-ROM, or network share) available for users to access via the computer's file system.
In general, the process of mounting comprises the operating system acquiring access to the storage medium; recognizing, reading, and processing file system structure and metadata on it before registering them to the virtual file system (VFS) component. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_(computing)#:~:text=Mounting%20is%20a%20process%20by,via%20the%20computer's%20file%20system.)
### Build
a build is the process of converting source code files into standalone software artifact(s) that can be run on a computer, or the result of doing so. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_build)

## setState
* React components can, and often do, have state. State can be anything, but think of things like whether a user is logged in or not and displaying the correct username based on which account is active. Or an array of blog posts. Or if a modal is open or not and which tab within it is active.
* React components with state render UI based on that state. When the state of components changes, so does the component UI.
* That makes understanding when and how to change the state of your component important. At the end of this tutorial, you should know how setState works, and be able to avoid common pitfalls that many of us hit when when learning React.

## Handling Events
Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:
* React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
* With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

## Forms
HTML form elements work a little bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.

## Components and Props
* Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

* Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.
