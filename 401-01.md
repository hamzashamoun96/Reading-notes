* Array.map is a method that will iterate over each element inside the array and executing a callback function for each element and it will retrn a new array after the exicution.

* Array.reduce is a method that will iterate over each element inside the array and executing a callback function called a reducer which takes four arguments (Accumulator, Current Value, Current Index, Source Array) and return a single output.

* Superaent with normal Promise .then():
```
let url = `https://api.covid19api.com/summary`
superagent.get(url)
    .then(result => {
        console.log(result)
    })

```

* Superaent with async / await :
```
async function allcountriesHandler (req,res){

    let url = `https://api.covid19api.com/summary`
    let Data = await superagent.get(url)
    console.log(Data)
}
```
* Promises in JavsScript as I understand it is a code will be read by JavaScript and pass over it and when it finished it then the related code to it will be executed.
* Not all Callback Functions considered to be Asynchronous , because there is some of array method used a callback function and it is not asynchronous.
