# Layouts
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
* It is common to group a number of elements together inside a < div> (or other block-level) element.
The position property in CSS allows you to control the layout of a page (norma flow, relative position, absolute position).
* Normal flow will appears every block element on a new line, Relative position allows you to shift elements to (Top, Bottom, Right, Left) and this
does not affect the position of surrounding elements.
* Absolute positioning allows you to position the element in relation to its containing element and this does not affect the position of surrounding elements.
* Z-index property allows you to control which box appears on top.
* Fixed position It positions the element in relation to the browser window. Therefore, when a user scrolls down the page, it stays in the exact same place.
* Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around (960-1000) pixels wide.
* Fixed width layouts designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window, Liquid layouts designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window and they tend to use percentages.
* We can include multiple CSS files in one page.
