### Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)
The singleton design pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance. This is done in order to provide coordinated access to a certain resource, throughout an entire software system. Through this design pattern, the singleton class ensures that it’s only instantiated once, and can provide easy access to the single instance.

### Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes
A singleton represents a single instance of an object. Only one can be created, no matter how many times the object is instantiated. If there’s already an instance, the singleton will create a new one. [medium](https://medium.com/@maheshkumawat_83392/node-js-design-patterns-singleton-pattern-series-1-1e0ab71e3edf)

### Router Middleware
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle.

### Dynamic Module Loading
Is a mechanism by which a computer program can, at run time, load a library (or other binary) into memory, retrieve the addresses of functions and variables contained in the library, execute those functions or access those variables, and unload the library from memory. It is one of the 3 mechanisms by which a computer program can use some other software; the other two are static linking and dynamic linking. Unlike static linking and dynamic linking, dynamic loading allows a computer program to start up in the absence of these libraries, to discover available libraries, and to potentially gain additional functionality.

### Singleton Pattern
Singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.
This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.

### Mock Testing
Mock testing is an approach to unit testing that lets you make assertions about how the code under test is interacting with other system modules. In mock testing, the dependencies are replaced with objects that simulate the behaviour of the real ones. The purpose of mocking is to isolate and focus on the code being tested and not on the behaviour or state of external dependencies.

## Securing Passwords with Bcrypt Hashing Function
Passwords are the first line of defense against cyber criminals. It is the most vital secret of every activity we do over the internet and also a final check to get into any of your user account, whether it is your bank account, email account, shopping cart account or any other account you have.
We all know storing passwords in clear text in your database is ridiculous. Many desktop applications and almost every web service including, blogs, forums eventually need to store a collection of user data and the passwords, that has to be stored using a hashing algorithm.
Cryptographic hash algorithms MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, SHA-3 are general purpose hash functions, designed to calculate a digest of huge amounts of data in as short a time as possible. Hashing is the greatest way for protecting passwords and considered to be pretty safe for ensuring the integrity of data or password.

## Basic access authentication
In the context of an HTTP transaction, basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser) to provide a user name and password when making a request. In basic HTTP authentication, a request contains a header field in the form of Authorization: Basic < credentials >, where credentials is the Base64 encoding of ID and password joined by a single colon.
