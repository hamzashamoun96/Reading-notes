# EJS
* EJS simply stands for Embedded Javascript, It is a simple templating language/engine that lets its user generate HTML
* first we need to install EJS from our terminal , then create a file with an extension of ejs to render what is inside it as a responce, also we can use the esj tag (<%= anything %>) in the that file and that is called inject a value in the rounte.
* There is a lot of thing we can do in the ejs tags such as for loops, if/else statements.
* There is also layout which is we can use to render the same thing on any route we make.
* EJS tags : 
<% 'Scriptlet' tag, for control-flow, no output <br>
<%_ ‘Whitespace Slurping’ Scriptlet tag, strips all whitespace before it<br>
<%= Outputs the value into the template (HTML escaped)<br>
<%- Outputs the unescaped value into the template<br>
<%# Comment tag, no execution, no output<br>
<%% Outputs a literal '<%'<br>
%> Plain ending tag<br>
-%> Trim-mode ('newline slurp') tag, trims following newline<br>
_%> ‘Whitespace Slurping’ ending tag, removes all whitespace after it
