# Redux - Asynchronous Actions

### How granular should your reducers be?
Some developers prefer to have “fat” action creators, with “thin” reducers that simply take the data in an action and blindly merge it into the corresponding state. Others try to emphasize keeping actions as small as possible, and minimize the usage of getState() in an action creator. [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47227419/react-redux-should-reducers-contain-any-logic)
### Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched
Con
### Name a strategy for preventing the above
Create different names for every reducer.

## TERM 
### store
A store holds the whole state tree of your application. The only way to change the state inside it is to dispatch an action on it. A store is not a class. It's just an object with a few methods on it. To create it, pass your root reducing function to createStore. [redux](https://redux.js.org/api/store#:~:text=A%20store%20holds%20the%20whole,root%20reducing%20function%20to%20createStore%20.)
### combined reducers
The combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore . The resulting reducer calls every child reducer, and gathers their results into a single state object. [redux](https://redux.js.org/api/combinereducers#:~:text=The%20combineReducers%20helper%20function%20turns,into%20a%20single%20state%20object.)

## Async Logic and Data Fetching REDUX
* Redux’s actions are dispatched synchronously, which is a problem for any non-trivial app that needs to communicate with an external API or perform side effects. Redux also allows for middleware that sits between an action being dispatched and the action reaching the reducers.

* There are two very popular middleware libraries that allow for side effects and asynchronous actions: Redux Thunk and Redux Saga. In this post, you will explore Redux Thunk.
## Thunk
* Thunk is a programming concept where a function is used to delay the evaluation/calculation of an operation.
* Redux Thunk is a middleware that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object. That function receives the store’s dispatch method, which is then used to dispatch regular synchronous actions inside the function’s body once the asynchronous operations have been completed.
