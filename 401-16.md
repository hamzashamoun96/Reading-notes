### What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
A standard queue tries to preserve the order of messages (best-effort), but there is a possibility of a message being delivered out of order , In a FIFO queue, messages are grouped into “Message groups” and all messages within a message group are sent and received in strict order.

### How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
By having an event in the client side to emit what received from the server side.
### What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
The Observer pattern.
### How do you test an event driven system?
By unit test.
## Terms

## Virtual Machine
* Is the virtualization/emulation of a computer system. 
* Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. 
* Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.

## Virtualization
* Is the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources.
* logically dividing the system resources provided by mainframe computers between different applications.

## AWS EC2
* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. 
* It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.
* Amazon EC2 offers the broadest and deepest compute platform with choice of processor, storage, networking, operating system, and purchase model.
