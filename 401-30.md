# Hashtables

* Hash is the result of some algorithim takin an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be
used for security or some other purpose.
* Buckets is what is  contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
* Collisions is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.
* Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.
* A hash is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location in the data structure that we can look at directly to retrieve the value.
* Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects. Some examples of how hashing is used in our lives include:
1) In universities, each student is assigned a unique roll number that can be used to retrieve information about them.
2) In libraries, each book is assigned a unique number that can be used to determine information about the book, such as its exact position in the library or the users it has been issued to etc.
* Hash table (hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
