# Images 
* There are many reasons to add images to a web page, you might want to include a logo, photpgrapg, diagram, chart or illustration.
* We can add images by using < img> tag with an attribute of (scr) to tell the browser where to get the image.
* We can specify height and width of the image.
* There is an old attribute called (align) which is used for images to align them (top,middle,bottom,right,left).
* There are several tool for editing images such as : Photoshop, Pixelmator, Paintshop Pro and much other.
* The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page.
* Animated GIFs show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations.
* Creating an image that is partially transparent (or "see-through") for the web involves selecting one of two formats:(PNG , Transparent GIF).
* < figure> tag allow you to have an image and It's caption also having a several images as long as they have the same caption, < figcaption> is the tag to add a caption for image/images inside the < figure> tag.

# Text
* when you choose a typeface to your website you should understand that a browser will display it if it's only installed on user's computer.
* To specify the typeface we use (font-family) property and the value of it will be the name of the typeface.
* To specify the size of type we use (font-size) property and the value of it will be in pixels, percentage or ems.
 * (@font-face) allows you to use a font even if the user's computer don't have it by allowing you to specify a path of a copy of the font which will be downloaded if it's not on the user's machine.
 * Also we can control the font appearance (normal, bold) by using (font-weight), and (italic, oblique) by using (font-style).
 * The text-align property allows you to control the alignment of text, The property can take one of four values: (left, right, center).
