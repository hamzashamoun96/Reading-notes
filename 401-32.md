# Custom Hooks

### What does a component’s lifecycle refer to?
mount , update , unmount
### Why do you sometimes need to “wrap” functions in useCallback when called from within useEffect
If you are passing the function on to child component as props and the child component doesn't often need re-rendering except when a certain prop change then useCallback might prevent certain re-renders. However if you state is complex and you need multiple such functions to be passed on to children as props, it better to shift to useReducer instead of useState and pass on the dispatch method to child components [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57156582/should-i-wrap-all-functions-that-defined-in-component-in-usecallback)
### Why are functional components preferred over class components?
because it is more readable
### What is wrong with the following code?
using th useEffect inside a for loop

### state hook
used with function components to add state to it by using useState.
### effect hook
adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount , componentDidUpdate , and componentWillUnmount in React classes.

### reducer hook
An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method. [reactjs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer)

## Custom Hooks
* Custom Hooks are a mechanism to reuse stateful logic (such as setting up a subscription and remembering the current value), but every time you use a custom Hook, all state and effects inside of it are fully isolated. How does a custom Hook get isolated state? Each call to a Hook gets isolated state.

* Custom Hooks are JavaScript functions whose names are prefixed with the word use. A custom Hook is a normal function but we hold them to a different standard. By adding the word use to the beginning, it lets us know that this function follows the rules of Hooks.

* With a better understanding of Hooks, let's take what we know to be a simple piece of code, our document title update, and create a simple custom Hook.
