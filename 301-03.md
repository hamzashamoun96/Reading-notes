# Javascript Templating 
* JavsScript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client side view templates with JavsScript by using JSON data source.
* The template is HTML markup , with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.
* The template engine then replaces variables & instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client.
# Mustache
* Mustache is a logic-less template syntax it can used for anything.
* It is often referred to as (logic-less) because there are no if statements , else or for loops , there are only tags.
* Mustache.js is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript.
* we would write templates according to the Mustache specification, and it can then be compiled by a templating engine to be rendered to create an output.
