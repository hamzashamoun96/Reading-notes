# Event Driven Applications

### Why is access control important?

it is important to make sure which users able to access the data and also to modify the security system for the web application.
### Describe an application that would need access control.
It is an application that have a lot of important data and very classified information and it maybe contain a financial info.
### What is a role used for?
Role is used to determine every user capability.
### Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
* Discretionary Access Control (DAC) allows each user to control access to their own data. DAC is typically the default access control mechanism for most desktop operating systems.
* RBAC assigns permissions to particular roles in an organization. Users are then assigned to that particular role.

## Terms

### Authorizition
Authorization is a security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources including files, services, computer programs, data and application features. [economictimes](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/authorization)
### Role Based Access Control
Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network. [digitalguardian](https://digitalguardian.com/blog what-role-based-access-control-rbac-examples-benefits-and-more)
### Capabilities
It is determined by the role of the user if he/she can read, create, update or delete.

## Event-Driven Programming in Node.js
* Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision. In this article we’re going to go over how Event-Driven Programming works and how we can make the best use of it in our Node.js projects.
* Most developers are introduced to concepts of Event-Driven Programming early on in their study of programming yet they might not fully realize it until a bit later. You’ll find that the concept is rather ubiquitous. Check any major framework or software out there and odds are you’ll find evidence of Event-Driven Programming.
