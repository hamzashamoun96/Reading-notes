# Login And Auth Components

### Why is the Context API useful?
because it allow us to make a global variables that are accessible throw all the app.
### Can a component outside of a provider get its context?
React context is available only when the UI is available. This means that on background tasks you can't access it. But that doesn't mean that you can't access it "outside" of components.
### What are some common use cases for using the Context API?
themes, languages
### Describe “Context Hell”
the React Context hell is the nasty code you get taking advantage of the React Context API.

### global state
Global states are used when components need to share states.
React provides a very good and simple way to manage local state(React hooks) but when it comes to global state management the options available are overwhelming.
### global context
Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.
### provider
Every Context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes.
### consumer
A React component that subscribes to context changes. Using this component lets you subscribe to a context within a function component.

## Role-Based Access

* Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.
* mployees are only allowed to access the information necessary to effectively perform their job duties. Access can be based on several factors, such as authority, responsibility, and job competency. In addition, access to computer resources can be limited to specific tasks such as the ability to view, create, or modify a file.
