# Sending form data
* the web uses a client/server architecture that can be summarized as follows. a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server (most of the time a web server).
* The < form> element defines how the data will be sent and The two most important attributes are action and method.
* The action attribute defines where the data gets sent and the method attribute defines how data is sent.
* The GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource (Read).
* The POST method it's the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request (Create).
# Button
* Buttons have many attributes such as : (name) which defines the unique identifier for that button within the form. It allows the server to access each button's value when submitted.
* The value attribute send the to the server when submitting the form.
* The type attribute which defines the button type (submit , reset).
