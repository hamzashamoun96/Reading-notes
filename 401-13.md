### What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?
It means that they handled both client-side and server-side, it is useful because it is provide Fast Reaction Time, Ongoing Updates, High-Frequency Messaging with Small Payloads. [windows](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/03/14/when-to-use-a-http-call-instead-of-a-websocket-or-http-2-0/#:~:text=WebSockets%20allow%20for%20a%20higher,each%20message%20sent%20and%20received.&text=When%20a%20client%20wants%20ongoing,are%20generally%20a%20good%20fit.)

### Does socket .io use HTTP? Why?
Yes, the initial connection setup it done over HTTP. Also, a socket .io server will attach to an HTTP server so it can serve its own client code through /socket.io/socket.io.js.

### What happens when a client emits an event?
It will go throught to the server and waiting for a listener to be fired.
### What happens when a server emits an event?
The client side will listen to the event and fire it if it is handled.
### What happens if a client “misses” an event?
Nothing will happend that affect the functionality.
### How can we mitigate this?
By having handler for each event.
## Terms

### Socket
 A socket is one end-point of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. [journals](http://journals.ecs.soton.ac.uk/java/tutorial/networking/sockets/definition.html)
### Web Socket
 is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)
### Socket .io
Socket .IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server.
### Client
is a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server as part of the client–server model of computer networks. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing)#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20a%20client%20is,by%20way%20of%20a%20network.)
### Server
A server is a computer that serves information to other computers (clients)
### OSI Model
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network. [imperva](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/osi-model/)
### TCP Model
The TCP/IP model was developed prior to the OSI model, consists of five layers: the application layer, transport layer, network layer, data link layer and physical layer. [javatpoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/computer-network-tcp-ip-model#:~:text=The%20TCP%2FIP%20model%20was,link%20layer%20and%20physical%20layer.)
### TCP
is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation through which application programs can exchange data. [searchnetworking](https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/TCP#:~:text=TCP%20(Transmission%20Control%20Protocol)%20is,of%20data%20to%20each%20other.)
### UDP
is a communications protocol that is primarily used for establishing low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet. It speeds up transmissions by enabling the transfer of data before an agreement is provided by the receiving party. [searchnetworking](https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/UDP-User-Datagram-Protocol#:~:text=UDP%20(User%20Datagram%20Protocol)%20is,provided%20by%20the%20receiving%20party.)
### Packets
are the basic units of communication over a TCP/IP network. Devices on a TCP/IP network divide data into small pieces, allowing the network to accommodate various bandwidths, to allow for multiple routes to a destination, and to retransmit the pieces of data which are interrupted or lost. [kb.iu.edu](https://kb.iu.edu/d/anyq#:~:text=Packets%20are%20the%20basic%20units,which%20are%20interrupted%20or%20lost.)

## Chat example using socket
* Sockets have traditionally been the solution around which most real-time chat systems are architected, providing a bi-directional communication channel between a client and a server.
* This means that the server can push messages to clients. Whenever you write a chat message, the idea is that the server will get it and push it to all other connected clients.

## Rooms and Namespaces
* A room is an arbitrary channel that sockets can join and leave. It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients.
* Namespace which essentially means assigning different endpoints or paths.
