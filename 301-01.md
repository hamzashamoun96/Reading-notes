# **Responsive Web Design and Floats**
* Responsive web design is that we build a website is suitable to work on every device no matter how large or small the screen is (Mobile or desktop).
* The responsive web design term itself was coined, and largely developed, by Ethan Marcotte.
## **Responsive , Adaptive and Mobile**
* Responsive and adaptive web design are closely related, responsive means to react quickly and positively to any change while adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation , and mobile means to build a seperated website commonly on a new domain for the mobile users. 
## **Flexible Layouts**
* It means the practice of building the layout of a website with a felxible grid , capable of dynamically resizing to any width.
* Flexible grids are built using relative lenght units , most commonlly percentages or em units.
## **The mobile first**
*  includes using styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default styles for a website, then use media queries to add styles as the viewport grows.
* The operating belief behind mobile first design is that a user on a mobile device, commonly using a smaller viewport, shouldnâ€™t have to load the styles for a desktop computer only to have them over written with mobile styles later. Doing so is a waste of bandwidth. Bandwidth that is precious to any users looking for a snappy website.
## **Float**
* Float is a CSS positioning property , usually used with images to set them into the page ( right or left )

* The clear property has four valid values : Both value which clears floats coming from left and right directions , Left & Right can be used to clear only the float coming from one direction , and None is the default value.
