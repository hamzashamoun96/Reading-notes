# Bearer Authorization

## Write the following steps in the correct order
1) Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret.
2) Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party.
3) Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint.
4) Make a request to the third-party API endpoint.
5) Receive authorization code.
6) Make a request to the access token endpoint.
7) Receive access token.

## What can you do with an authorization code?
The only thing you can do with the authorization code is to make a request to get an access token.
## What can you do with an access token?
Access tokens are the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user. The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user’s data. [oauth](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/#:~:text=Access%20tokens%20are%20the%20thing,in%20transit%20and%20in%20storage.)
## What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
* OAuth 2.0 is a very flexible protocol that relies on SSL (Secure Sockets Layer that ensures data between the web server and browsers remain private) to save user access token.

* OAuth 2.0 relies on SSL which is used to ensure cryptography industry protocols and are being used to keep the data safe.

* It allows limited access to the user's data and allows accessing when authorization tokens expire.

* It has ability to share data for users without having to release personal information.

* It is easier to implement and provides stronger authentication. [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/oauth2.0/oauth2.0_overview.htm#:~:text=Advantages%20of%20OAuth%202.0&text=It%20allows%20limited%20access%20to,implement%20and%20provides%20stronger%20authentication.)

### Client ID
The client_id is a public identifier for apps. Even though it’s public, it’s best that it isn’t guessable by third parties, so many implementations use something like a 32-character hex string. It must also be unique across all clients that the authorization server handles. If the client ID is guessable, it makes it slightly easier to craft phishing attacks against arbitrary applications. [oauth2](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/client-registration/client-id-secret/)
### Client Secret
The client_secret is a secret known only to the application and the authorization server. It must be sufficiently random to not be guessable, which means you should avoid using common UUID libraries which often take into account the timestamp or MAC address of the server generating it. A great way to generate a secure secret is to use a cryptographically-secure library to generate a 256-bit value and converting it to a hexadecimal representation. [oauth2](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/client-registration/client-id-secret/)
### Authentication Endpoint
Endpoint authentication is an authentication mechanism used to verify the identity of a network's external or remote connecting device. These endpoint devices include laptops, smartphones, tablets, and servers. [iotone](https://www.iotone.com/term/end-point-authentication/t219#:~:text=Endpoint%20authentication%20is%20an%20authentication,external%20or%20remote%20connecting%20device.&text=This%20method%20ensures%20that%20only,%2C%20smartphones%2C%20tablets%20and%20servers.)
### Access Token Endpoint
A token endpoint is an HTTP endpoint that micropub clients can use to obtain an access token given an authorization code. [indieweb](https://indieweb.org/token-endpoint#:~:text=A%20token%20endpoint%20is%20an,token%20given%20an%20authorization%20code.)
### API Endpoint
an endpoint is one end of a communication channel. When an API interacts with another system, the touchpoints of this communication are considered endpoints. For APIs, an endpoint can include a URL of a server or service. Each endpoint is the location from which APIs can access the resources they need to carry out their function. [smartbear](https://smartbear.com/learn/performance-monitoring/api-endpoints/#:~:text=Simply%20put%2C%20an%20endpoint%20is,of%20a%20server%20or%20service.)
### Authorization Code
An authorization code is an alphanumeric password that authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space. An authorization code is typically a sequence of letters, numbers, or a combination of both, that validates a person's identity, approves a transaction or provides access to a secured area. [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/authorization-code.asp#:~:text=An%20authorization%20code%20is%20an,into%20a%20security%2Dprotected%20space.)
### Access Token
Access tokens are used in token-based authentication to allow an application to access an API. The application receives an access token after a user successfully authenticates and authorizes access, then passes the access token as a credential when it calls the target API. The passed token informs the API that the bearer of the token has been authorized to access the API and perform specific actions specified by the scope that was granted during authorization.

## JWT
* It stand for JSON Web Token , It is an open standard source which mean that anyone can use it, and it used to securely transfer information between any two bodies (users , servers),
and it is compact which means that it can be send via url, post 
request , http header which make it more usuable.
* JWT Structure : Header which contain algorithim and the type, payload contain user details, signature.

## When should you use JSON Web Tokens?
* Authorization: This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains.
* Information Exchange: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.
