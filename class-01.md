# HTML
* There are different ways in which people access the web and clarify some terminology: first we have web browsers (Chrome,Interet explorer,Fire fox,Safari),Second web servers which are a special computer hosts the website,also we have screen readers which are programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user.
 * All websites use HTML & CSS, but when we are dealing with a larger websites we use a content management system(CMS).
 * When we want to visit a website the browser will connect to a domain name system (DNS) in order to locate the web server hosting the website.
 * HTML describes the structure of a web page using elements, all elements has a opening (< p>) and closing tags (</ p>) that inform the browser about the information between these tags.
 * Also we can put attributes to the elements to provide more information about the contents of the element and they appear on the opening tag.
 * In order to write a HTML code for a website there is an important elements we should know about: body element (< body>),head element (< head>),title element(< title>) and they all will be inside a html element (< html>),and evey web page must begins with a doctype decleration (< !DOCTYPE html>) to declare which version of html is using.
 * We can add comments to html code by writing the comment between a < !-- comment here -->.
 * Every HTML element can carry the id attribute and it is used to uniquely identify that element and there is no way that two elements can have the same id.
 * Ever HTML elements can carry a class attribute it is used to identify several elements that are different from the other elements.
 * Block elements will always appear on a new line in the browser window, Inline elements will appear to continue on the same line in the browser.
 * < div> element alows you to ggroup a set of elements together in one block, < span> element acts like an inline equivalent of the < div> element and it is Contain a section of text
where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text.
* < ifram> element is like a little window that has been cut into your page and in that window you can see another page. 
< meta> element lives inside the < head> element and contains information about that web page.
* < header> and < footer> elements can be used for the main header and footer that appears at the top or bottom of every web page.
* < nav> element is used to contain the navigational blocks on the site.
< section> element is used to group related content togther and each section have its own heading.
* < hgroup> element is used to group a set of one or more heading elements so they are treated as one single heading.
* In HTML5 you can turn an entire block into a link by placing a < a> element aroud the block.
* In order to make older browser understand the HTML5 element you need to include a line in CSS which states which new elements should treated as a block-level elements.
* Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner, It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.
* Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized, and good navigation tends to follow these principles :Concise, Clear, Selective, Context, Interactive and Consistent.
# JAVASCRIPT
* Javascipt allows to to add more interactive to your website by: Access content, modify content, Prorsm rules and react to events, and you can change the content of an HTML page while its loaded in the browser such as : Slideshows, Forms, Reload part of page and Filtering data.
* Script is a series of instructions that a compute can follow to achieve a goal and before writing a script you need to define the goal of it then design it and then start coding it.
* The best way to write a javascript is to write it in Its own file and then refare to it in the < script> element.
When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML < script> element to tell the browser it is coming across a script, Its src attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.
