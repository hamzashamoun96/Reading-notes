# Hooks API

### Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
because we can render what ever we want in the same page using react router dom.
### If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
Inside the < BrowserRouter/>, outside a < Route/>
because we didn't specify a route for it so it will render on every page.
### What does props.children contain?
what props.children does is that it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.


## Terms

### Composition
composition is a natural pattern of the component model. It's how we build components from other components, of varying complexity and specialization through props. [dev](https://dev.to/bouhm/thinking-in-react-component-composition-fp5#:~:text=In%20React%2C%20composition%20is%20a,in%20building%20many%20other%20components.)
### Children / Child Components
Children allow you to pass components as data to other components, just like any other prop you use. The special thing about children is that React provides support through its ReactElement API and JSX. XML children translate perfectly to React children.

### Hash Routing
A <Router> that uses the hash portion of the URL (i.e. window.location.hash) to keep your UI in sync with the URL. [reactrouter](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/HashRouter)
### Link Routing
Provides declarative, accessible navigation around your application. [reactrouter](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Link)

## What is a Hook? 
A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. We’ll learn other Hooks later.

## Why Hooks?
* We know that components and top-down data flow help us organize a large UI into small, independent, reusable pieces. However, we often can’t break complex components down any further because the logic is stateful and can’t be extracted to a function or another component. Sometimes that’s what people mean when they say React doesn’t let them “separate concerns.”
* These cases are very common and include animations, form handling, connecting to external data sources, and many other things we want to do from our components. When we try to solve these use cases with components alone, we usually end up with:
* Huge components that are hard to refactor and test.
* Duplicated logic between different components and lifecycle methods.
* Complex patterns like render props and higher-order components.
