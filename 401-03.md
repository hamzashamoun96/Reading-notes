# Express REST API

### Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware
1) Checking for the request if it matches the handlers.
2) Detecting error before the response.
3) Fixing the request to be used correctly.

### True or false: The route handler is middleware ?
false 
### In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?
The middleware will end the process and send an error with it's callback function called ( next ) with a parameter of the next function.
### At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware ?
It can injected between the route and the route handler.
### What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response” ?
The error "Error: Can't set headers after they are sent." means that you're already in the Body or Finished state,
but some function tried to set a header or statusCode. When you see this error, try to look for anything that tries to send a header after some of the body has already been written.

# Terms

## Middleware
is software that lies between an operating system and the applications running on it. Essentially functioning as hidden translation layer, middleware enables communication and data management for distributed applications.
[MiddleWare](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-middleware/#:~:text=Middleware%20is%20software%20that%20lies,data%20management%20for%20distributed%20applications.)

## Request Object
The request object is the main entry point for an application to issue a request to the Library - all operations on a URL must use a Request object. The request object is application independent in that both servers and clients use the same Request class.

## Response Object
Response Object contains the server's response to the HTTP request.

## Application Middleware
is software that provides services beyond those provided by the operating system to enable the various components of a distributed system to communicate and manage data.

## Routing Middleware
a middleware that works on router level.

## Test Driven Development
Writing the test before writing the code means that we need to know the requirements of the software and the specification of the code before starting to code the solution.

## Behavioral Testing
Behavioural Testing is a testing of the external behaviour of the program, also known as black box testing. It is usually a functional testing.
