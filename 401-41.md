### Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”
* Ducks is essentially a proposal for bundling reducers, action types, and actions all into the same file.
* Ducks seeks to solve the issue of the toggled back and forth repetitive nature of organizing by type. With Ducks, rather than splitting up all related code, I can package it into redux modules.

### What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
This toolkit provides some useful libraries and has comfort functions to make the syntax of Redux a bit more understandable. Also the code becomes a bit more compact because default values are used for many things. The Redux Toolkit is flexible and can be combined with normal Redux without problems.

## Terms
### redux toolkit slices
A Redux Slice is a collection of reducer logic and actions for a single feature of our app. The name “slice” comes from the idea that we’re splitting up the root Redux state object into multiple “slices” of slate. [medium](https://medium.com/swlh/redux-in-react-js-reducers-and-slices-bafafec781e3)
### namespace
A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (the names of types, functions, variables, etc) inside it. Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions that can occur especially when your code base includes multiple libraries.

## React Native
* React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook, Inc. It is used to develop applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS,tvOS, Web, Windows and UWP by enabling developers to use React's framework along with native platform capabilities.
* React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks.
* React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
## Expo.io
Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.
## Snack Expo.io
* It's an open-source platform for running React Native apps in the browser. You can write React Native code and run it directly in Expo Go or even in the browser.
## ExpoKit 
ExpoKit is an Objective-C and Java library that allows you to use the Expo platform and your existing Expo project as part of a larger standard native project -- one that you would normally create using Xcode, Android Studio, or react-native init.
