# Access Control (ACL)
## When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
* Basic Authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. The client sends HTTP requests with the Authorization header that contains the word Basic word followed by a space and a base64-encoded string username:password. For example, to authorize as demo / p@55w0rd the client would send. [swagger](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/basic-authentication/).
* Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources. [swagger](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/).
## What does the JSON Web Token package do?
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA,although JWTs can be encrypted to also provide secrecy between parties, we will focus on signed tokens. Signed tokens can verify the integrity of the claims contained within it, while encrypted tokens hide those claims from other parties. When tokens are signed using public/private key pairs, the signature also certifies that only the party holding the private key is the one that signed it. [jwt](https://jwt.io/introduction#:~:text=JSON%20Web%20Token%20(JWT)%20is,because%20it%20is%20digitally%20signed.)
## What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
* Store secret safely in .env.
* Add .env to .gitignore to prevent push it online.

### encryption
Encryption is a means of securing digital data using one or more mathematical techniques, along with a password or "key" used to decrypt the information. The encryption process translates information using an algorithm that makes the original information unreadable. The process, for instance, can convert an original text, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext. When an authorized user needs to read the data, they may decrypt the data using a binary key. This will convert ciphertext back to plaintext so that the authorized user can access the original information. [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/encryption.asp)
### token
 A token is an object that represents something else, such as another object (either physical or virtual), or an abstract concept as, for example, a gift is sometimes referred to as a token of the giver's esteem for the recipient. In computers, there are a number of types of tokens. [techtarget](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/token)
### bearer
A Bearer Token is an opaque string, not intended to have any meaning to clients using it. Some servers will issue tokens that are a short string of hexadecimal characters, while others may use structured tokens such as JSON Web Tokens. [oauth](https://oauth.net/2/bearer-tokens/#:~:text=A%20Bearer%20Token%20is%20an,such%20as%20JSON%20Web%20Tokens.)
### secret
 secret string stored on the server used to sign and encode the token.
### JSON Web Token
JSON web token (JWT), pronounced "jot", is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. Again, JWT is a standard, meaning that all JWTs are tokens, but not all tokens are JWTs. [auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/json-web-tokens)

# Role Based Access Control
RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in an organization. It's important to remember that not every employee needs a starring role.
### Comparing RBAC with ACL
RBAC differs from access control lists (ACLs), used in traditional discretionary access-control systems, in that RBAC systems assign permissions to specific operations with meaning in the organization, rather than to low-level data objects. For example, an access control list could be used for granting or denying write access to a particular system file, but it would not dictate how that file could be changed. In an RBAC-based system, an operation might be to 'create a credit account' transaction in a financial application or to 'populate a blood sugar level test' record in a medical application. The assignment of permission to perform a particular operation is meaningful, because the operations are granular with meaning within the application. RBAC has been shown to be particularly well suited to separation of duties (SoD) requirements, which ensure that two or more people must be involved in authorizing critical operations. Necessary and sufficient conditions for safety of SoD in RBAC have been analyzed. An underlying principle of SoD is that no individual should be able to effect a breach of security through dual privilege. By extension, no person may hold a role that exercises audit, control or review authority over another, concurrently held role.
