# Combined Reducers

### Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?
* Context API: Resourceful and ideal for small applications where state changes are minimal
* Redux: Perfect for larger applications where there are high-frequency state updates [codehousegroup](https://www.codehousegroup.com/insight-and-inspiration/tech-stream/using-redux-and-context-api#:~:text=Context%20API%20is%20easy%20to,creating%20unnecessary%20work%20and%20complexity.)
### What is the purpose of a reducer?
A reducer is a function that determines changes to an application's state. It uses the action it receives to determine this change. We have tools, like Redux, that help manage an application's state changes in a single store so that they behave consistently.

### What does an action contain?
payload of information
### Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?
They are not allowed to modify the existing state. Instead, they must make immutable updates, by copying the existing state and making changes to the copied values. [redux](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-3-state-actions-reducers)

## Term

### immutable state
is state that cannot be changed
### time travel in redux
The Redux DevTools records dispatched actions and the state of the Redux store at every point in time. This makes it possible to inspect the state and travel back in time to a previous application state without reloading the page or restarting the app. [medium](https://medium.com/the-web-tub/time-travel-in-react-redux-apps-using-the-redux-devtools-5e94eba5e7c0#:~:text=The%20Redux%20DevTools%20records%20dispatched,page%20or%20restarting%20the%20app.)
### action creator
is merely a function that returns an action object
### reducer
is a function that determines changes to an application's state. It uses the action it receives to determine this change.
### dispatch
is a function of the Redux store. You call store.dispatch to dispatch an action. This is the only way to trigger a state change.

## Using combineReducers
* The most common state shape for a Redux app is a plain Javascript object containing "slices" of domain-specific data at each top-level key. Similarly, the most common approach to writing reducer logic for that state shape is to have "slice reducer" functions, each with the same (state, action) signature, and each responsible for managing all updates to that specific slice of state. Multiple slice reducers can respond to the same action, independently update their own slice as needed, and the updated slices are combined into the new state object.
* Because this pattern is so common, Redux provides the combineReducers utility to implement that behavior. It is an example of a higher-order reducer, which takes an object full of slice reducer functions, and returns a new reducer function. [redux](https://redux.js.org/recipes/structuring-reducers/using-combinereducers/)
* reducers (Object): An object whose values correspond to different reducing functions that need to be combined into one. See the notes below for some rules every passed reducer must follow.
