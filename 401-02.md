### Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST

* REST APIs (Representational State Transfer) are based on URI's (Uniform Resource Identifier, of which a URL is a specific type) and the HTTP protocol, and use JSON for a data format, which is super browser-compatible.
* SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is its own protocol, and is a bit more complex by defining more standards than REST—things like security and how messages are sent.
