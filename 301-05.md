# Heroku 
* It is a cloud application platform which turns a local server into a world wide server.
* It is supporting several programming languages. One of the first cloud platforms, Heroku has been in development.
* The Heroku network runs the customer's apps in virtual containers which execute on a reliable runtime environment. Heroku calls these containers "Dynos". These Dynos can run code written in Node, Ruby, PHP, Go, Scala, Python, Java, or Clojure. Heroku also provides custom buildpacks with which the developer can deploy apps in any other language.
* Applications that are run on Heroku typically have a unique domain used to route HTTP requests to the correct application container
