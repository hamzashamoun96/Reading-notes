# Call Stack 
* A call stack is a mechanisim for an interpreter (like JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of it's place in a script that calls multiple functions (what function is currently running and what functions are called from within that function).
* A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point.

## Types of error massages
* The first thing that indicates you that something is wrong with your code is the (in)famous error message which is "Uncaught TypeError".
* When you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get an error "Uncaught ReferenceError".
* Syntax errors this occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax.
* Type errors this types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.

# Debugging
* To debug your JS code, the easiest and maybe the most common way its to simply console.log() the variables you want to check or, by using chrome developer tools, open your page with your JS code.
