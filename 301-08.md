# SQL
* Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.
* Relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables , which has a fixed number of named columns and any number of rows of data.
* Write SELECT statements To retrieve data from a SQL database , and we can retrieve absolutely all the columns of data from a table using the asterisk (*) shorthand in place of listing all the column names individually.
* In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a WHERE clause in the query. The clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the results or not.
* SQL provides a convenient way to discard rows that have a duplicate column value by using the DISTINCT keyword.
